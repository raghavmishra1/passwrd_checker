# Password Checker Tool - Prodigy InfoTech Task
I am pleased to share my latest project, a Password Checker Tool, developed as part of a task for Prodigy InfoTech. This tool is designed to evaluate the strength and security of passwords, ensuring they meet best practices for protection against unauthorized access.

# Key Features:
🔐 Strength Evaluation: Analyzes passwords based on criteria such as length, complexity, and use of different character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

⚠️ Security Guidelines: Provides feedback on password strength and suggests improvements to enhance security.

📊 Customizable Rules: Allows for customizable strength requirements to align with specific security policies or guidelines.

🔄 User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to easily check their passwords and receive actionable feedback.

# Purpose
This tool aims to help users create strong passwords that can protect against common security threats, contributing to better overall security practices. It was a valuable project that deepened my understanding of password security principles and Python programming.
